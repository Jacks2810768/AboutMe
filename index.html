    <p>I love to make, invent, and build.<br>
       I've had a 3D printer for some time.<br>

    <h2>
        My Future Plans
    </h2>
  <p>
    My future plans are to go to college at MIT<br>
    for a major in computer sicence. And after that<br>
    I think my dream job would be to work at NASA JPL<br>
    in Pasadena, Calofornia.

    <h2>
        My Current Projects
    </h2>
    <p>
        One of my on going projects is a robotic dog<br>
        almost like Boston Dynamics Spot, I'm going to<br>
        3D print the parts and then use a xbox controller<br>
        to send the inputs to a Rassberry Pi, that will use costom code<br>
        to control outputs of servos creating the movment of a leg,<br>
        though I'll have to study the dynamic movement of legs<br>
        I think it will be fun!
